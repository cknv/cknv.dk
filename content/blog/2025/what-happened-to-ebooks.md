A while ago I bought an ebook reader, expecting that I could buy ebooks from many different shops and transfer the files to the reader that that would be that.
Instead, I find that the ebook "shops" only sells link to some DRM infested download manager hosted by Adobe, all of which means I cannot buy books from my computers running linux - what happened?

In addition the ebook reader also has to sign into various accounts to get the certificates that enables the reader to actually use those encrypted ebook files.

Seems like nobody has realized that increasing the friction drives away customers - no wonder ebooks have not really become mainstream.
