A while ago I bought an ebook reader, expecting that I could buy ebooks from many different shops and transfer the files to the reader that that would be that.
Instead, I find that the ebook "shops" only sells link to some DRM infested download manager hosted by Adobe, all of which means I cannot buy books from my computers running linux - what happened?

In addition the ebook reader also has to sign into various accounts to get the certificates that enables the reader to actually use those encrypted ebook files.
Which actually means that readers do not have control over their libraries, since the ability to read the books is tied to the certificate which can be pulled at any time.

Seems to me that nobody realized that increasing friction drives away customers - no wonder ebooks have not really become mainstream.

I guess I will just have to read old public domain books where I can actually just download the files and transfer via USB.
