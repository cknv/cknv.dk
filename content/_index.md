This is my website, it has a little about me and some very sporadic writings, I do not expect to write much or to be particulary insightful, but as I am told the only way to get better at something it to keep doing it.

The site is partly made from a longing for the old internet that we used to have, where individuals could express themselves creatively on the internet without having to rely on large corperations for a place to be heard.
To some extend this is probably just nostalgia, but the corporate internet where almost every site is build on venture capital and has to make a profit off the users is probably unhealthy.

The internet of yesteryear absolutely had problems, but with the new corporate internet I think we have mostly just traded one set of problems for another.

At the time of writing this, the idea of an "indienet" has been rising, but still only exists at the margins of the corporate internet as it exists.
I hope I can be small part of making the internet more independent and less reliant on corporations, even if just by writing.
