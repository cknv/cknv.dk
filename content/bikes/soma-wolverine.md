After riding a fixed gear bike for about 8 years, I wanted to be able to go out on short day trips, but the some

- Carry cargo.
- Ride on gravel roads.
- Low maintenance.

The idea really came to me when I saw the Soma Wolverine frame on one of the articles about bike frames capable of having a belt drive on [cyclingabout.com](https://cyclingabout.com) - the lugged fork and classic looks got to me.

I took inspiration for the bike from various kinds of bikes, randonneur bikes, moden gravel bikes and expedition bikes.
While my needs are much more simple and I probably mostly use it for utility bicycling in and around Copenhagen.

The bike is built up with drop handlebars and an Shimano Alfine 8 internal gear hub, which is an unusual combination, since there is no gear shifters for that hub that can fit on that kind of handlebars.
However Microshift makes a thumb shifter, and via [a page on joe-bike.com](https://www.joe-bike.com/product/microshift-bar-end-shifter-for-alfine-8-nexus-8-2271.htm) I found out it is possible to disassemble it and mount it on the downtube bosses that the wolverine frame has.
This is a bit of a hack that has some consequences down the line with regards of cable adjustment but it works fine.
