Based on an old Centurion frame I bought already sandblasted, I built my first bike.
Since I did not really know anything about building bikes, the goal was to keep it as simple as possible - while still being legal under Danish law.

That meant skipping gears, as I did not want to have to learn about derailleurs, and instead could focus my energy on wheels, brakes and brake levers, handlebars, bottom bracket, cranks and all the other basic parts that makes a bike rideable.

In the end ended up as nice workhorse that I rode as my primary bike for 8 years.
What eventually convinced me to build a new bike was the fairly aggresive riding position - too aggressive for my level of fitness and the need to have a bike better suited for short one day trips out of the city, and the narrow tires was not very suited for riding over gravel paths.

I still have it (in storage), and maybe I will rebuild it as a singlespeed, with a more upright riding position and wider tires - a sunday bike.
