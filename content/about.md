Hello, my name is Esben.
I write software for a living.

Occasionally I write public code which can often be found at [github.com/cknv](https://github.com/cknv), and sometimes I find bugs and help others to try and fix their software.

I do not really engage in social media, but I can be found on [dk.linkedin.com/in/esbensonne](http://dk.linkedin.com/in/esbensonne) since that is pretty much required to apply for jobs these days.
