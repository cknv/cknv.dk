Hello, my name is Esben.
I write software for a living.

Occasionally I write public code which can often be found at [github.com/cknv/](https://github.com/cknv/), and sometimes I find bugs and help others to try and fix their software.

I do not really engage in social media, I do happen to have a [linkedin profile](http://dk.linkedin.com/in/esbensonne/) since that is required to apply for jobs these days.
